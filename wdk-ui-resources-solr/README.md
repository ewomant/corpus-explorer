# WdK-Explorer Interface 

The interface is based on Apache Solr's default UI Solritas / [VelocityResponsewriter](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Velocity+Response+Writer) and uses an extended set of [Velocity](https://velocity.apache.org/)-Templates together with client-side JS/JQuery/D3-Scipts. We augment results with comparative statistics, vizualisations and links to the original collection. 

Below, the prerequisites of a WdK-Explorer Installation are explained with suggestions regarding where future changes to the index-structure need to be accomodated. 


Solr
------
WdK-Explorer Interface has been tested with Version Solr Version 6.1 and 6.2. Solr should be started with at least 3 GB of Java Heap-Memory to support complex Statistics-Queries, e.g. `bin\solr  start -m 4g`

Warning: VelocityResponsewriter is not meant to be used in production. To expose the UI publicly, some saftey measures have to be taken (see below).

All configuration-files described below are included as prepared for the current index and fieldnames:

- [src/main/resources/solr/WdK/](src/main/resources/solr/WdK/) contains examples of configuration-files for the core WdK-Explorer-core: conf und lib, which need to be copied to the
- [src/main/resources/solr/WdK/conf](src/main/resources/solr/WdK/conf) contains a schema.xml and a solrconfig.xml which may need to be adapted for new fields
- [src/main/resources/solr/WdK/conf/velocity](src/main/resources/solr/WdK/conf/velocity) contains velocity-templates, javascript-files and stylesheets necessary for the interface, otpimzed for the WdK-Corpus. Here, config.vm may need to be adapted for new fields
 - [src/main/resources/solr/kjl/conf](src/main/resources/solr/kjl/conf) contains a schema.xml and a solrconfig.xml which are optimized for a childrens' literature corpus (kjl = Kinder und Jugenliteratur). However, the velocity-templates are not up to date and the config.vm will have to be adapted. An example config.vm for a kjl-corpus is included in the folder velocity but has not been tested.




solrconfig.xml-Configuration for WdK-Explorer
----

For WdK-Explorer, two requestHandler need to be defined

### SearchHandler **/browse**
This is the SearchHandler for VelocityResponsewriter. Here, primarily the facets that are needed for every request are defined with an exclude-Tag {!ex=fieldname} to provide for multi-select-facetting. All facets are displayed in the interface in the order defined here, grouped by facet-type (facet.query, facet.range, facet.field). In addition, settings for facets that are not activated by default may be defined here. This way, only the facets themselves need to be defined in the query-URL.

### SearchHandler **/json**
This SearchHandler is used to fetch additional queries from the index in client side scripts. It should **closely model the query-behaviour of /browse**, but does not need to predefine facets and returns json as default-format.


### Additional Libraries
The assocTool [wdk-ui-assocTool](.wdk-ui-assocTool) is used to calculate loglikelihood-ratios in the statsview-table. It is inserted as an additional tool into the VecolityResponseWriter.

```xml
<queryResponseWriter name="velocity" class="solr.VelocityResponseWriter" startup="lazy">
   <lst name="tools">   
       <str name="assoc">de.uni_hildesheim.iw.wdk.velocity.assocTool.AssocTool</str>
    </lst>
</queryResponseWriter>
```    
   
The interface needs to be able to load the *wdk-ui-assocTool.jar* in the core's /lib directory, with dependencies either included as jars or included into wdk-ui-assocTool.jar - Alternativly they may be placed in Solr's general lib-directory.

The tool can be used from within velocity-templates calling functions of the `$assoc` object. 

schema.xml - field configuration during indexing
---
The UI assumes certain datatypes of the fields declared in [schema.xml](src/main/resources/solr/WdK/conf/schema.xml)

- Fields starting with `goobi_` will by default, this behaviour is overriden for some fields which need different processing
- Fields ending in `_wdk` or `_opac` (from the *csv-files) are by default  indexed as multivalued, indexed string fields and stored, this behaviour is overriden for some fields which need different processing 
- fields starting on `topic_` contain the topic-intensity in the corpus and are expected to be of field-type `tdouble`
- fields ending on `_topwords` expect topics to be indexed as string without preprocessing: These fields are used to extract topicnames throughout the tool. 
- there are two types of preprocessed text-fields: `text_de`  is being analyzed as German text while `text_preprocessed` is only tokenized at whitespaces and expects text that has already been normalized and is currently used to conveniently provide the text in the form as used in topic-modeling.
- the following fields that are not created automatically are expected to be of type "int": `goobi_PublicationYear`, `page`, `Afz_wdk`  
- `goobi_PublicationYear` needs to be 4-digits long in the form yyyy
- The fields marked with  <!-- Multiple value metadata count fields --> are needed to provide the unique-value-option on multi-valued-fields
- a `solr.RandomSortField` is included to draw randomized samples from the corpus




velocity/config.vm-Configuration of fieldnames and topicmodels
----
All Index-specific variables are collected in the configuration-file config.vm. Here, the names of 
topicmodels, their sizes and topicmodelnames are defined. All fields used for faceting and display can be defined here.

In addition, the current version of the index is defined which is used to display the correct documentation from velocity/doc.


Documenting the current index in velocity/doc 
----

To make decisions for indexing and topic-modeling transparent, the most important steps are documented for each core and displayed in the client for the current core in the footer of each result-page

* date the collection was exported
* date the additional metadata were exported
* description of the index-creation process
* description of topic-models


Securing access to VelocityResponsewriter
-----

If WdK-Explorer needs to be made accessible publicly, access is needed to the following paths:
* solr/[core-name]/browse 
* solr/[core-name]/json
* solr/admin/file

Access to other paths should be restricted, e.g. using a reverse proxy server, to prevent commits/updates/deletes of documents in the index from other sources.

Access to the admin-interface can be secured by changing the authentication of the admin-web-app.
